## MICROSERVICES 2.0

<table text-align="top">
 <tr>
   <td>
    An open-source project that is focused on streamlining reactive-programming of Microservices Reactive-systems that scale, built by developers for developers.<br><br>
ScaleCube Services provides a low latency Reactive Microservices library for peer-to-peer service registry and discovery 
based on gossip protocol, without single point-of-failure or bottlenecks.<br><br>
    Scalecube more gracefully address the cross cutting concernes of distributed microservices architecture.

ScaleCube Services Features:

* Provision and interconnect microservices as a service-mesh (cluster)</li>
* Reactive Streams support.
  * Fire And Forget - Send and not wait for a reply
  * Request Response - Send single request and expect single reply
  * Request Stream - Send single request and expect stream of responses. 
  * Request bidirectional - send stream of requests and expect stream of responses.
* No single-point-of-failure or single-point-of-bottleneck
* Cluster aware and distributed
* Modular, flexible deployment models and topology
* Zero configuration, automatic peer-to-peer service discovery using gossip
* Simple non-blocking, asynchronous programming model
* Resilient due to failure detection, fault tolerance, and elasticity
* Routing and balancing strategies for both stateless and stateful services
* Low latency and high throughput
* Takes advantage of the JVM and scales over available cores
* Embeddable to existing Java applications
* Natural Circuit-Breaker due to tight integration with scalecube-cluster failure detector.
* Support Service instance tagging.
* pluggable api-gateway providers (http / websocket / rsocket)
* pluggable service transport
* pluggable encoders

Basic Usage:

The example provisions 2 cluster nodes and making a remote interaction. 
1. seed is a member node and provision no services of its own. 
2. then microservices variable is a member that joins seed member and provision GreetingService instance.
3. finally from seed node - create a proxy by the GreetingService api and send a greeting request. 

```java
    //1. ScaleCube Node node with no members
    Microservices seed = Microservices.builder().startAwait();

    //2. Construct a ScaleCube node which joins the cluster hosting the Greeting Service
    Microservices microservices =
        Microservices.builder()
            .discovery(
                serviceEndpoint ->
                    new ScalecubeServiceDiscovery(serviceEndpoint)
                        .options(opts -> opts.seedMembers(toAddress(seed.discovery().address()))))
            .setupTransport(RSocketTransportResources::new)
            .transportFactory(RSocketServiceTransportFactory::new)
            .services(new GreetingServiceImpl())
            .startAwait();

    //3. Create service proxy
    GreetingsService service = seed.call().api(GreetingsService.class);

    // Execute the services and subscribe to service events
    service.sayHello("joe").subscribe(consumer -> {
      System.out.println(consumer.message());
    });
```

Basic Service Example:


* RequestOne: Send single request and expect single reply
* RequestStream: Send single request and expect stream of responses.
* RequestBidirectional: send stream of requests and expect stream of responses.

A service is nothing but an interface declaring what methods we wish to provision at our cluster.

```java

@Service
public interface ExampleService {

  @ServiceMethod
  Mono<String> sayHello(String request);

  @ServiceMethod
  Flux<MyResponse> helloStream();

  @ServiceMethod
  Flux<MyResponse> helloBidirectional(Flux<MyRequest> requests);
}

```

## API-Gateway:

Available api-gateways are [rsocket](/services-gateway-rsocket), [http](/services-gateway-http) and [websocket](/services-gateway-websocket)

Basic API-Gateway example:

```java

    Microservices.builder()
        .discovery(options -> options.seeds(seed.discovery().address()))
        .services(...) // OPTIONAL: services (if any) as part of this node.

        // configure list of gateways plugins exposing the apis
        .gateway(options -> new WebsocketGateway(options.id("ws").port(8080)))
        .gateway(options -> new HttpGateway(options.id("http").port(7070)))
        .gateway(options -> new RSocketGateway(options.id("rsws").port(9090)))
        
        .startAwait();
        
        // HINT: you can try connect using the api sandbox to these ports to try the api.
        // http://scalecube.io/api-sandbox/app/index.html
```

### Maven

With scalecube-services you may plug-and-play alternative providers for Transport,Codecs and discovery. 
Scalecube is using ServiceLoader to load providers from class path, 
  
You can think about scalecube as slf4j for microservices - Currently supported SPIs: 

**Transport providers:**

* scalecube-services-transport-rsocket: using rsocket to communicate with remote services.

**Message codec providers:**

* scalecube-services-transport-jackson: using Jackson to encode / decode service messages. https://github.com/FasterXML
* scalecube-services-transport-protostuff: using protostuff to encode / decode service messages. https://github.com/protostuff
 
**Service discovery providers:**

* scalecube-services-discovery: using scalecue-cluster do locate service Endpoint within the cluster
