# ScaleCube

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scalecube/scalecube.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scalecube/scalecube)

**ScaleCube** is **embeddable** microservices framework for the rapid development of distributed, resilient, reactive
applications that scales. It connects distributed microservices in a way that resembles a fabric 
when viewed collectively. It greatly simplifies and streamlines asynchronous programming and provides a tool-set for 
managing [microservices architecture](http://microservices.io/patterns/index.html). ScaleCube has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, 
and flexibility without a compromise.

## Project Status

This is an alpha version of the project and it is **not** stable or production ready as for now. 
Your [feedback](https://github.com/scalecube/scalecube/issues) is welcome.

## Explore
ScaleCube contains several different components designed to make it easier for you to write reactive applications in java. it is highly modular and you just use the bits that you need and nothing more.

ScaleCube is a library not a restrictive container so you don't have to only use components provided by ScaleCube. You can also use ScaleCube with all the usual libraries that you like.
